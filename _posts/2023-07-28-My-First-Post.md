# Why am I writing a blog post?
I've never actually written a blog post, because I never really believed I had **anything** important to say. 
*But*, lately I've been doing many things I've never done before, trying new things. 

## What will I do next?
Write now I'm writing a blog post, it's supposed to be part of my site on github, made using github pages. 
I hope this will be useful, and I can make another test site with perhaps more content as further practice. 

One of the uses for github pages seems to be for portfolio websites. So, I'd like to ultimately make a 
portfolio website some day soon on github pages. 
>Unless I find a better way to host a website. Is this even technically a way to host a website? I'm not sure.
